The NBA top scorers project analyzes NBA data from years 1950 - 2017 using csv data files from www.kaggle.com. 
Data web link location: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/nba-players-stats
There are 3 data files available. The "Seasons_Stats.csv" file will be used for this project.
This projects analyzes the top NBA scores from 1950 - 2017 and creates visual scatter plot graphs displaying
the top scores for all seasons combined 1950 - 2017 and the top 2 scores for each season 1950 - 2017.
The first graph displays a scatter plot of the top scores for all players in seasons 1950 - 2017.
The second graph displays a scatter plot of the top scores for each season 1950 - 2017.
The third graph displays a scatter plot of the runner up (2nd) top scores for each season 1950 - 2017.

The project is organized in a Jupiter notebook using Python version 3.9.12. The Anaconda application 
should be installed to run this analysis so that the pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn libraries 
can be utilized.

Project file name: TimothyWalkerNBA.ipynb

Project features:

1. - A csv file is read into a dataframe for analysis ("Seasons_Stats.csv" from kaggle.com).
   - The data frame of player demographics is put into a library.

2. - Nan and null values are removed from the data. Also columns with statistics that will not be 
     used in this analysis, are removed.
   - The data is put into a condensed frame that focuses on player demographics including player name, 
     team played, season year, point scored during that year, position, and age.

3. - Total player count, mean age, youngest age, oldest age, maximum points scored, minimum points scored
     and age / point at 25%, 50%, and %75 points in the data analysis.
   - Functions are used to organize the players in the data by season and top scorers for each season. 
     A function also sort and creates new data list with the top and runner-up (2nd) top scorer for each 
     season.

4. - Three graphs are created from the analyzed data. The first graph shows the top scores for all
     seasons, 1950- 2017. The second graph shows the top scores for each season, 1950 - 2017. The third graph 
     shows the runner up top score for each season, 1950 - 2017.

5. - The project was built using a Jupiter notebook. Jupiter can be installed by going to the 
     site https://jupyter.org/install. Refe to the reference.txt document for install directions.
     The project notebook follows step by step the process using to analyze and represent the data 
     in this project.
